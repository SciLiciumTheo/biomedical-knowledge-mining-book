	abstract = {Functional enrichment analysis is pivotal for interpreting high-throughput omics data in life science. It is crucial for this type of tool to use the latest annotation databases for as many organisms as possible. To meet these requirements, we present here an updated version of our popular Bioconductor package, {clusterProfiler} 4.0. This package has been enhanced considerably compared with its original version published 9 years ago. The new version provides a universal interface for functional enrichment analysis in thousands of organisms based on internally supported ontologies and pathways as well as annotation data provided by users or derived from online databases. It also extends the dplyr and ggplot2 packages to offer tidy interfaces for data operation and visualization. Other new features include gene set enrichment analysis and comparison of enrichment results from multiple gene lists. We anticipate that {clusterProfiler} 4.0 will be applied to a wide range of scenarios across diverse organisms.},

Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis ({GSEA)} for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how {GSEA} yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, {GSEA} reveals many biological pathways in common. The {GSEA} method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

	abstract = {Summary: The {RDAVIDWebService} package provides a class-based interface from R programs/scripts to fully access/control the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery, without the need for human interaction on its Web site (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov). The library enhances the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery capabilities for Gene Ontology analysis by means of {GOstats}-based direct acyclic graph conversion methods, in addition to the usual many-genes-to-many-terms visualization.
Availability and implementation: {RDAVIDWebService} is available as an R package from the Bioconductor project (www.bioconductor.org) and on the authors’ Web site (www.bdmg.com.ar) under {GPL}-2 license, subjected to the terms of use of {DAVID} (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/content.jsp?file={WS}.html).

	abstract = {Background
Dynamics of polyadenylation vs. deadenylation determine the fate of several developmentally regulated genes. Decay of a subset of maternal {mRNAs} and new transcription define the maternal-to-zygotic transition, but the full complement of polyadenylated and deadenylated coding and non-coding transcripts has not yet been assessed in Xenopus embryos.

Results
To analyze the dynamics and diversity of coding and non-coding transcripts during development, both polyadenylated {mRNA} and ribosomal {RNA}-depleted total {RNA} were harvested across six developmental stages and subjected to high throughput sequencing. The maternally loaded transcriptome is highly diverse and consists of both polyadenylated and deadenylated transcripts. Many maternal genes show peak expression in the oocyte and include genes which are known to be the key regulators of events like oocyte maturation and fertilization. Of all the transcripts that increase in abundance between early blastula and larval stages, about 30\% of the embryonic genes are induced by fourfold or more by the late blastula stage and another 35\% by late gastrulation. Using a gene model validation and discovery pipeline, we identified novel transcripts and putative long non-coding {RNAs} ({lncRNA}). These {lncRNA} transcripts were stringently selected as spliced transcripts generated from independent promoters, with limited coding potential and a codon bias characteristic of noncoding sequences. Many {lncRNAs} are conserved and expressed in a developmental stage-specific fashion.

Conclusions
These data reveal dynamics of transcriptome polyadenylation and abundance and provides a high-confidence catalogue of novel and long non-coding {RNAs}.},

abstract ={Subjective methods have been reported to adapt a general-purpose ontology for a specific application. For example, Gene Ontology (GO) Slim was created from GO to generate a highly aggregated report of the human-genome annotation. We propose statistical methods to adapt the general purpose, OBO Foundry Disease Ontology (DO) for the identification of gene-disease associations. Thus, we need a simplified definition of disease categories derived from implicated genes. On the basis of the assumption that the DO terms having similar associated genes are closely related, we group the DO terms based on the similarity of gene-to-DO mapping profiles. Two types of binary distance metrics are defined to measure the overall and subset similarity between DO terms. A compactness-scalable fuzzy clustering method is then applied to group similar DO terms. To reduce false clustering, the semantic similarities between DO terms are also used to constrain clustering results. As such, the DO terms are aggregated and the redundant DO terms are largely removed. Using these methods, we constructed a simplified vocabulary list from the DO called Disease Ontology Lite (DOLite). We demonstrated that DOLite results in more interpretable results than DO for gene-disease association tests. The resultant DOLite has been used in the Functional Disease Ontology (FunDO) Web application at http://www.projects.bioinformatics.northwestern.edu/fundo.Contact: s-lin2@northwestern.edu},
